## Welcome to the Hawk Project

In partnership with WeRobotics and OpenAerialMap, the World Bank’s UAVs for Disaster Resilience Program captured roughly 80 KM^2 of high resolution (under 10 cm) aerial imagery in one Small Island State in October 2017.

This project is an attempt to automate the analysis of the aforementioned imagery.
